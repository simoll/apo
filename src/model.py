import tensorflow as tf

## advanced setup ##
## input sequence of statements:
# (oc : one-hot, opOne, opTwo)
# (oc : one-hot, constant)

## output:
# pointer (ptr network output, one element)
# rule distribution (softmax over finite rule set)

# units:
# LSTM


## basic setup ##
# multi-layer CNN (one-hot encodings everywhere)
